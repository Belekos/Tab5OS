/*
 * The PC speaker: port 61h bit 1 and the timer's channel 2 (gated by bit
 * 0) driving one cone
 *
 * The cone is pushed while bit 1 is set and channel 2's output is high (or
 * its gate is off: then bit 1 alone, which is how programs play samples by
 * toggling it). Each 44.1 kHz sample is the share of its time the cone was
 * pushed (the timer's ticks within it; the square wave worked out), caught
 * up whenever the timer or port 61h change and at each frame's end, then a
 * slow high pass takes the steady level away. The Sound Blaster's samples
 * join each one (sound_sample()), the AdLib's on the speaker's task
 * (sound_mix()). A ring the speaker's task takes from, as esp32arc's.
